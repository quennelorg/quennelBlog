## How to have extraordinary execution power
> You don't need to have everything done perfectly from the beginning. Don't let your ideals interfere with objective facts.

### [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
In agile development, the emphasis is on an iterative process rather than trying to do everything perfectly from the start. Especially in a fast-paced world, there is nothing that can be done perfectly right from the beginning. Before starting something or a project, embrace the idea that there will be failures along the way and then proceed with a joyful mindset.

### [City Skylines](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines/about)
When playing City Skylines, there are often times when we feel stuck or lack the courage to start a new game. It's usually because we think about planning the road network, industrial areas, residential zones, public facilities, and even amusement parks right from the beginning. These plans become like mountains that weigh us down whenever we want to start a game.

Later on, it becomes clear that there is no task in this world that can consider every aspect at once before implementation. It's impossible to maintain interest in something if we give up starting because we are too focused on planning. Starting again becomes difficult in such cases.

### Perfection
Lack of execution power often stems from wanting to achieve perfection right from the start.

If you want to do something well, it doesn't mean you have to do it perfectly in one go. It's about gradually improving and deciding how well is well enough, based on subjective understanding.

If we demand the current self to meet this ideal, the gap will be significant. It becomes so big that we start despising ourselves and lose the desire to start anything.

Ideals don't exist in reality; they remain as thoughts. In this lifetime, we need to compromise on many things, but the most important compromise is with ourselves. Progress is made by taking small steps while constantly compromising. Over time, we'll realize that we have left many marks behind.

Act based on the objective reality, such as the abilities we currently possess, the ideas we can think of, what we can achieve right now, and the external support available. Slowly move closer to the ideals in our minds, and the gap will shrink. That part of the gap shrinking is progress.

Because, first and foremost, we need to take action, not aim for perfection. However, taking action doesn't mean not thinking. It's better to analyze the "5W1H" of the task first before starting, and then begin. Otherwise, if we keep saying "let's start, let's start" without knowing what we're actually doing, we won't be able to make any real progress.

The most important thing is that we don't need to achieve perfection from the beginning. There is no such thing as perfection in this world. Completion is more important than perfection.
