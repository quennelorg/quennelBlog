## Strategy
- This pattern is very simple, the Strategy pattern, as the name suggests, is a pattern that focuses on strategies. For different algorithms, we can implement them separately and separate various logics. This allows for reusability in other places, making it a powerful tool in refactoring.
- Moreover, this pattern can easily solve the problem of excessive if statements. We can extract different logics for these if conditions.
- In addition, after extracting these algorithms, we can perform unit testing specifically for these algorithms. This ensures stability, and if there are any changes in requirements, we can safely and quickly make modifications.

### Plus Factory
The Strategy pattern can eliminate a lot of if statements, while the Factory pattern can eliminate a lot of duplicate code. We can use the factory to decide which behavior to implement, and then use the instances generated by the factory to determine which strategy to use.
