## Don't save API keys on the frontend
The initial idea was to adjust the key on the front end. At this time, I found that after publishing it, the key appeared in the calling interface in clear text.  
So if someone checks the network, the request will expose the key, so the correct method is to put the key on the backend. The backend handles private content and deploys it on a private server or serverless cloud, such as AWS, GCP, Alibaba Cloud, etc.
