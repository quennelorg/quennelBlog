## Design patterns Study 1

Starting today, I am going to study software design patterns. I have studied them in school before, but most of them have been given back to the teacher.
In practice, I don’t remember much. Many times I may have used certain design patterns, but I can’t tell exactly which ones were used.
I vaguely remember that the clearest ones are single responsibility, prototypes, factories, etc. The most commonly used ones are to extract methods for reuse in refactoring, and divide the responsibilities of methods as clearly as possible. It is best for one method to correspond to one function.
Next, the design pattern will be researched and recorded.

The future will continue------------
